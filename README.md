# deluge-utm-to-zoho-fields

Thought I'd share this simple script I added to Zoho to add UTM parameters into different Zoho fields after a contact form is submitted. This only works if you set up a cookie via tag manager, so the UTM data persists of course. There are lots of tutorials for that if you haven't done it before. 

Anyway, hope this helps someone out there!
